## Root Cause

The **`db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co`** hostname resolves **only to IPv6** address, but your network **does not support IPv6** or has no route to the IPv6 address.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Enable IPv6 on Your Network (Recommended)
If you have IPv6 available from your ISP, enable it in your network settings.

### Option 2: Use Direct Database Connection (Port 5432)
Supabase also provides direct connection on port 5432. However, this may also be IPv6-only.

Try changing the DATABASE_URL in your `.env` file to:
```bash
# Direct connection (Session mode)
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

### Option 3: Use Supabase Pooler with IPv4 (If Available)
Check your Supabase project settings for an IPv4 endpoint:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy/settings/database
2. Look for "Connection String" section
3. Check if there's an IPv4 connection option
4. Look for "Connection Pooling" settings

### Option 4: Use IPv6 Proxy/Tunnel
Set up an IPv6 to IPv4 proxy or tunnel:
- Use Cloudflare WARP
- Use a VPN with IPv6 support
- Use SSH tunnel through a server with IPv6

### Option 5: Use Supabase REST API Instead
For some operations, you can use Supabase's REST API which works over IPv4:
```
https://sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co
```

### Option 6: Contact Supabase Support
Ask Supabase to provide an IPv4 endpoint for database connections. Some projects may have IPv4 endpoints available.

## Additional Network Information

Main domain IPv4 addresses (for reference):
```
sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co:
  - 8.6.112.6
  - 8.47.69.6
```

The main Supabase API endpoint is accessible via IPv4, but the database pooler endpoint is IPv6-only.

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
dig db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co A
dig db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co AAAA

# Check IPv6 connectivity
ping6 db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co

# Test with psql (if installed)
psql "host=db.sjrfppeisxmglrozufoy.supabase.co port=6543 dbname=postgres user=postgres sslmode=require"

# Check if your system has IPv6
ifconfig | grep inet6
```

## Recommendation

**Immediate action**: Check your Supabase project dashboard for IPv4 connection strings or enable IPv6 on your network.

**Best practice**: For production environments, ensure IPv6 connectivity is available, as many cloud providers (including Supabase) are moving towards IPv6-only infrastructure.
